# Project1
This project allows the user to change the time by adding hours, minutes and seconds. Not to mention, the project will return the time in military time and standard time. I think I did good when it came to the logic of the code but the user interface could use some work. If I enanced the user interface, then the user would have an easier time using this program. The hardest part of this project was insuring that the values I change for standard time would not stack with the changes for military time. I got past this by using temporary values for military time which makes sure that the values are accurate and do not affect one another. One of my previous coding teachers taught me this trick for simple programs. Using temporary values is very useful for projects like this one. Skills that can be transfered from this project would be thinking more about the user. User interface is very important and in future projects I will pay more attention to making sure that the user has an easy time using my program. To make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable I decided to make my code simple. Keeping your code simple allows for changes if issues arise and very easy for people to read.
